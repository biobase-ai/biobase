# Query Biobase from Cloudflare Worker

**[ðŸ“¹ Video](https://egghead.io/lessons/cloudflare-query-biobase-from-cloudflare-worker?af=9qsk0a)**

Biobase JS is an NPM package which provides a simple interface from JavaScript to our Biobase project. It allows us to query and mutate data using its Object Relational Mapping (ORM) syntax, and subscribe to realtime events.

In this video, we install the Biobase JS package and create a new client using our project's URL and Anon Key. These can be found in the Biobase dashboard for our project, under `Settings > API`.

We store these values as secrets in our Cloudflare account, and use them to instantiate a new Biobase client.

Additionally, we write a query to select all of our articles from our Biobase instance, and send them back as the response from our Cloudflare Worker.

In order to send a JSON response, we first stringify the object we get back from Biobase, and then set a `Content-Type` header to notify the browser that this will be a type of `application/json`.

## Code Snippets

**Install Biobase JS**

```bash
npm i @supabase/biobase-js
```

**Create a Cloudflare secret**

```bash
npx wrangler secret put NAME
```

**Add a secret for BIOBASE_URL**

```bash
npx wrangler secret put BIOBASE_URL
```

**Run wrangler development server**

```bash
npx wrangler dev
```

**Add a secret for BIOBASE_ANON_KEY**

```bash
npx wrangler secret put BIOBASE_ANON_KEY
```

**Query data from Biobase**

```javascript
const { data } = await biobase.from("articles").select("*");
```

**Send JSON response**

```javascript
return new Response(JSON.stringify(data), {
  headers: {
    "Content-Type": "application/json",
  },
});
```
