      Generate the autocompletion script for the zsh shell.

      If shell completion is not already enabled in your environment you will need
      to enable it.  You can execute the following once:

          echo "autoload -U compinit; compinit" >> ~/.zshrc

      To load completions in your current shell session:

          source <(biobase completion zsh); compdef _biobase biobase

      To load completions for every new session, execute once:

      #### Linux:

          biobase completion zsh > "${fpath[1]}/_biobase"

      #### macOS:

          biobase completion zsh > $(brew --prefix)/share/zsh/site-functions/_biobase

      You will need to start a new shell for this setup to take effect.
