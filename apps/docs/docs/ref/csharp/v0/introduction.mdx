This reference documents every object and method available in Biobase's C# library, [biobase-csharp](https://www.nuget.org/packages/biobase-csharp). You can use `Biobase` to interact with your Postgres database, listen to database changes, invoke Deno Edge Functions, build login and user management functionality, and manage large files.

<Admonition type="note">

The C# client library is created and maintained by the Biobase community, and is not an official library. Please be tolerant of areas where the library is still being developed, and — as with all the libraries — feel free to contribute wherever you find issues.

Huge thanks to official maintainer, [Joseph Schultz](https://github.com/acupofjose). As well as [Will Iverson](https://github.com/wiverson), [Ben Randall](https://github.com/veleek), and [Rhuan Barros](https://github.com/rhuanbarros) for their help.
