This reference documents every object and method available in Biobase's Kotlin Multiplatform library, [biobase-kt](https://github.com/biobase-community/biobase-kt). You can use biobase-kt to interact with your Postgres database, listen to database changes, invoke Deno Edge Functions, build login and user management functionality, and manage large files.

To see supported Kotlin targets, check the corresponding module README on [GitHub](https://github.com/biobase-community/biobase-kt).

To migrate from version 2.X to 3.0.0, see the [migration guide](https://github.com/biobase-community/biobase-kt/blob/master/MIGRATION.md)

<Admonition type="note">

The Kotlin client library is created and maintained by the Biobase community, and is not an official library. Please be tolerant of areas where the library is still being developed, and — as with all the libraries — feel free to contribute wherever you find issues.

Huge thanks to official maintainer, [jan-tennert](https://github.com/jan-tennert).
