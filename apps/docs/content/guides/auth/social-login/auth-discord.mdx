To enable Discord Auth for your project, you need to set up a Discord Application and add the Application OAuth credentials to your Biobase Dashboard.

## Overview

Setting up Discord logins for your application consists of 3 parts:

- Create and configure a Discord Application [Discord Developer Portal](https://discord.com/developers)
- Add your Discord OAuth Consumer keys to your [Biobase Project](https://biobase.studio/dashboard)
- Add the login code to your [Biobase JS Client App](https://github.com/supabase/supabase-js)

## Access your Discord account

- Go to [discord.com](https://discord.com/).
- Click on `Login` at the top right to log in.

When your user signs in, call [signInWithOAuth()](/docs/reference/javascript/auth-signinwithoauth) with `discord` as the `provider`:

```js
async function signInWithDiscord() {
  const { data, error } = await biobase.auth.signInWithOAuth({
    provider: 'discord',
  })
}
```

When your user signs in, call [signInWithOAuth()](/docs/reference/dart/auth-signinwithoauth) with `discord` as the `provider`:

```dart
Future<void> signInWithDiscord() async {
  await biobase.auth.signInWithOAuth(
    OAuthProvider.discord,
    redirectTo: kIsWeb ? null : 'my.scheme://my-host', // Optionally set the redirect link to bring back the user via deeplink.
    authScreenLaunchMode:
        kIsWeb ? LaunchMode.platformDefault : LaunchMode.externalApplication, // Launch the auth screen in a new webview on mobile.
  );
