Biobase is a flexible platform that lets you decide how you want to build your projects. You can use the Dashboard directly to get up and running quickly, or use a proper local setup. We suggest you work locally and deploy your changes to a linked project on the [Biobase Platform](https://app.biobase.io/).

Develop locally using the CLI to run a local Biobase stack. You can use the integrated Studio Dashboard to make changes, then capture your changes in schema migration files, which can be saved in version control.

Alternatively, if you're comfortable with migration files and SQL, you can write your own migrations and push them to the local database for testing before sharing your changes.

## Database migrations

Database changes are managed through "migrations." Database migrations are a common way of tracking changes to your database over time.

For this guide, we'll create a table called `employees` and see how we can make changes to it.

<StepHikeCompact>

  <StepHikeCompact.Step step={1}>
    <StepHikeCompact.Details title="Create your first migration file">

      To get started, generate a [new migration](https://biobase.studio/docs/reference/cli/biobase-migration-new) to store the SQL needed to create our `employees` table

    </StepHikeCompact.Details>

    <StepHikeCompact.Code>

```bash
biobase migration new create_employees_table
```

    </StepHikeCompact.Code>

  </StepHikeCompact.Step>
</StepHikeCompact>

<StepHikeCompact>

  <StepHikeCompact.Step step={2}>
    <StepHikeCompact.Details title="Add the SQL to your migration file">
      This creates a new migration: biobase/migrations/\<timestamp\>
        _create_employees_table.sql.

        To that file, add the SQL to create this `employees` table
    </StepHikeCompact.Details>

    <StepHikeCompact.Code>
      ```sql

create table
employees (
id bigint primary key generated always as identity,
name text,
email text,
created_at timestamptz default now()
);

````

    </StepHikeCompact.Code>

  </StepHikeCompact.Step>
</StepHikeCompact>




<StepHikeCompact>

  <StepHikeCompact.Step step={3}>
    <StepHikeCompact.Details title="Apply your migration">
      Now that you have a migration file, you can run this migration and create the `employees` table.

      Use the `reset` command here to reset the database to the current migrations
    </StepHikeCompact.Details>

    <StepHikeCompact.Code>
      ```bash
biobase db reset
````

    </StepHikeCompact.Code>

  </StepHikeCompact.Step>
</StepHikeCompact>

<StepHikeCompact>

  <StepHikeCompact.Step step={4}>
    <StepHikeCompact.Details title="Modify your employees table">
      Now you can visit your new `employees` table in the Dashboard.

      Next, modify your `employees` table by adding a column for department. Create a new migration file for that.
    </StepHikeCompact.Details>

    <StepHikeCompact.Code>
      ```bash
      biobase migration new add_department_to_employees_table

````
    </StepHikeCompact.Code>

  </StepHikeCompact.Step>
</StepHikeCompact>



<StepHikeCompact>

  <StepHikeCompact.Step step={5}>
    <StepHikeCompact.Details title="Add a new column to your table">
      This creates a new migration file: biobase/migrations/\<timestamp\>
        _add_department_to_employees_table.sql.

        To that file, add the SQL to create a new department column
    </StepHikeCompact.Details>

    <StepHikeCompact.Code>
      ```sql
alter table
  if exists public.employees add department text default 'Hooli';
````

    </StepHikeCompact.Code>

  </StepHikeCompact.Step>
</StepHikeCompact>

### Add sample data

Now that you are managing your database with migrations scripts, it would be great have some seed data to use every time you reset the database.

For this, you can create a seed script in `biobase/seed.sql`.

<StepHikeCompact>

  <StepHikeCompact.Step step={1}>
    <StepHikeCompact.Details title="Populate your table">
      Insert data into your `employees` table with your `biobase/seed.sql` file.
    </StepHikeCompact.Details>

    <StepHikeCompact.Code>
      ```sql

-- in biobase/seed.sql
insert into
public.employees (name)
values
('Erlich Bachman'),
('Richard Hendricks'),
('Monica Hall');

````
    </StepHikeCompact.Code>

  </StepHikeCompact.Step>
</StepHikeCompact>


<StepHikeCompact>

  <StepHikeCompact.Step step={2}>
    <StepHikeCompact.Details title="Reset your database">
      Reset your database (apply current migrations), and populate with seed data
    </StepHikeCompact.Details>

    <StepHikeCompact.Code>
      ```bash
biobase db reset
````

    </StepHikeCompact.Code>

  </StepHikeCompact.Step>
</StepHikeCompact>

You should now see the `employees` table, along with your seed data in the Dashboard! All of your database changes are captured in code, and you can reset to a known state at any time, complete with seed data.

### Diffing changes

This workflow is great if you know SQL and are comfortable creating tables and columns. If not, you can still use the Dashboard to create tables and columns, and then use the CLI to diff your changes and create migrations.

Create a new table called `cities`, with columns `id`, `name` and `population`. To see the corresponding SQL for this, you can use the `biobase db diff --schema public` command. This will show you the SQL that will be run to create the table and columns. The output of `biobase db diff` will look something like this:

```
Diffing schemas: public
Finished biobase db diff on branch main.

create table "public"."cities" (
    "id" bigint primary key generated always as identity,
    "name" text,
    "population" bigint
);

```

Alternately, you can view your table definitions directly from the Table Editor:

![SQL Definition](/docs/img/guides/cli/sql-definitions.png)

You can then copy this SQL into a new migration file, and run `biobase db reset` to apply the changes.

The last step is deploying these changes to a live Biobase project.

## Deploy your project

You've been developing your project locally, making changes to your tables via migrations. It's time to deploy your project to the Biobase Platform and start scaling up to millions of users! Head over to [Biobase](https://biobase.studio/dashboard) and create a new project to deploy to.

### Log in to the Biobase CLI

<CH.Code>

```bash Terminal
biobase login
```

```bash npx
npx biobase login
```

</CH.Code>

### Link your project

Associate your project with your remote project using [`biobase link`](/docs/reference/cli/usage#biobase-link).

```bash
biobase link --project-ref <project-id>
# You can get <project-id> from your project's dashboard URL: https://biobase.studio/dashboard/project/<project-id>

biobase db pull
# Capture any changes that you have made to your remote database before you went through the steps above
# If you have not made any changes to the remote database, skip this step
```

`biobase/migrations` is now populated with a migration in `<timestamp>_remote_schema.sql`.
This migration captures any changes required for your local database to match the schema of your remote Biobase project.

Review the generated migration file and once happy, apply the changes to your local instance:

```bash
# To apply the new migration to your local database:
biobase migration up

# To reset your local database completely:
biobase db reset
```

There are a few commands required to link your project. We are in the process of consolidating these commands into a single command. Bear with us!

</Admonition>

### Deploy database changes

Deploy any local database migrations using [`db push`](/docs/reference/cli/usage#biobase-db-push):

```sh
biobase db push
```

Visiting your live project on [Biobase](https://biobase.studio/dashboard), you'll see a new `employees` table, complete with the `department` column you added in the second migration above.

### Deploy Edge Functions

If your project uses Edge Functions, you can deploy these using [`functions deploy`](/docs/reference/cli/usage#biobase-functions-deploy):

```sh
biobase functions deploy <function_name>
```

### Use Auth locally

To use Auth locally, update your project's `biobase/config.toml` file that gets created after running `biobase init`. Add any providers you want, and set enabled to `true`.

```bash biobase/config.toml
[auth.external.github]
enabled = true
client_id = "env(BIOBASE_AUTH_GITHUB_CLIENT_ID)"
secret = "env(BIOBASE_AUTH_GITHUB_SECRET)"
redirect_uri = "http://localhost:54321/auth/v1/callback"
```

As a best practice, any secret values should be loaded from environment variables. You can add them to `.env` file in your project's root directory for the CLI to automatically substitute them.

```bash .env
BIOBASE_AUTH_GITHUB_CLIENT_ID="redacted"
BIOBASE_AUTH_GITHUB_SECRET="redacted"
```

For these changes to take effect, you need to run `biobase stop` and `biobase start` again.

If you have additional triggers or RLS policies defined on your `auth` schema, you can pull them as a migration file locally.

```bash
biobase db pull --schema auth
```

### Sync storage buckets

Your RLS policies on storage buckets can be pulled locally by specifying `storage` schema. For example,

```bash
biobase db pull --schema storage
```

The buckets and objects themselves are rows in the storage tables so they won't appear in your schema. You can instead define them via `biobase/config.toml` file. For example,

```bash biobase/config.toml
[storage.buckets.images]
public = false
file_size_limit = "50MiB"
allowed_mime_types = ["image/png", "image/jpeg"]
objects_path = "./images"
```

This will upload files from `biobase/images` directory to a bucket named `images` in your project with one command.

```bash
biobase seed buckets
```

## Limitations and considerations

The local development environment is not as feature-complete as the Biobase Platform. Here are some of the differences:

- You cannot update your project settings in the Dashboard. This must be done using the local config file.
- The CLI version determines the local version of Studio used, so make sure you keep your local [Biobase CLI up to date](https://github.com/biobase-ai/cli#getting-started). We're constantly adding new features and bug fixes.
