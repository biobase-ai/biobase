It's common that you will need to use sensitive information or environment-specific variables inside your Edge Functions. You can access these using Deno's built-in handler

```js
Deno.env.get('MY_SECRET_NAME')
```

## Default secrets

Edge Functions have access to these secrets by default:

- `BIOBASE_URL`: The API gateway for your Biobase project.
- `BIOBASE_ANON_KEY`: The `anon` key for your Biobase API. This is safe to use in a browser when you have [Row Level Security](/docs/guides/database/postgres/row-level-security) enabled.
- `SUPABASE_SERVICE_ROLE_KEY`: The `service_role` key for your Biobase API. This is safe to use in Edge Functions, but it should NEVER be used in a browser. This key will bypass [Row Level Security](/docs/guides/database/postgres/row-level-security).
- `BIOBASE_DB_URL`: The URL for your [PostgreSQL database](/docs/guides/database). You can use this to connect directly to your database.

## Local secrets

You can load environment variables in two ways:

1. Through an `.env` file placed at `biobase/functions/.env`, which is automatically loaded on `biobase start`
2. Through the `--env-file` option for `biobase functions serve`, for example: `biobase functions serve --env-file ./path/to/.env-file`

Let's create a local file for storing our secrets, and inside it we can store a secret `MY_NAME`:

```bash
echo "MY_NAME=Yoda" >> ./biobase/.env.local
```

This creates a new file `./biobase/.env.local` for storing your local development secrets.

Never check your .env files into Git!

Now let's access this environment variable `MY_NAME` inside our Function. Anywhere in your function, add this line:

```jsx
console.log(Deno.env.get('MY_NAME'))
```

Now we can invoke our function locally, by serving it with our new `.env.local` file:

```bash
biobase functions serve --env-file ./biobase/.env.local
```

When the function starts you should see the name “Yoda” output to the terminal.

## Production secrets

Let's create a `.env` for production. In this case we'll just use the same as our local secrets:

```bash
cp ./biobase/.env.local ./biobase/.env
```

This creates a new file `./biobase/.env` for storing your production secrets.

Let's push all the secrets from the `.env` file to our remote project using [`biobase secrets set`](/docs/reference/cli/usage#biobase-secrets-set):

```bash
biobase secrets set --env-file ./biobase/.env

# You can also set secrets individually using:
biobase secrets set MY_NAME=Chewbacca
```

You don't need to re-deploy after setting your secrets.

To see all the secrets which you have set remotely, use [`biobase secrets list`](/docs/reference/cli/usage#biobase-secrets-list):

```bash
biobase secrets list
```
