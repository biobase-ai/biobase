Biobase Auth makes it easy to implement authentication and authorization in your app. We provide client SDKs and API endpoints to help you create and manage users.

Your users can use many popular Auth methods, including password, magic link, one-time password (OTP), social login, and single sign-on (SSO).

## About authentication and authorization

Authentication and authorization are the core responsibilities of any Auth system.

- **Authentication** means checking that a user is who they say they are.
- **Authorization** means checking what resources a user is allowed to access.

Biobase Auth uses [JSON Web Tokens (JWTs)](/docs/guides/auth/jwts) for authentication. Auth integrates with Biobase's database features, making it easy to use [Row Level Security (RLS)](/docs/guides/database/postgres/row-level-security) for authorization.

## The Biobase ecosystem

You can use Biobase Auth as a standalone product, but it's also built to integrate with the Biobase ecosystem.

Auth uses your project's Postgres database under the hood, storing user data and other Auth information in a special schema. You can connect this data to your own tables using triggers and foreign key references.

Auth also enables access control to your database's automatically generated [REST API](/docs/guides/api). When using Biobase SDKs, your data requests are automatically sent with the user's Auth Token. The Auth Token scopes database access on a row-by-row level when used along with [RLS policies](/docs/guides/database/postgres/row-level-security).
