## Overview

The Vercel Marketplace is a feature that allows you to manage third-party resources, such as Biobase, directly from the Vercel platform. This integration offers a seamless experience with unified billing, streamlined authentication, and easy access management for your team.

When you create an organization and projects through Vercel Marketplace, they function just like those created directly within Biobase. However, the billing is handled through your Vercel account, and you can manage your resources directly from the Vercel dashboard or CLI. Additionally, environment variables are automatically synchronized, making them immediately available for your connected projects.

For more information, see [Introducing the Vercel Marketplace](https://vercel.com/blog/share/introducing-the-vercel-marketplace) blog post.

Details coming soon..

### Connecting to Biobase Project

Biobase Projects created via Vercel Marketplace are automatically synchronized with connected Vercel projects. This synchronization includes setting essential environment variables, such as:

```
POSTGRES_URL
POSTGRES_PRISMA_URL
POSTGRES_URL_NON_POOLING
POSTGRES_USER
POSTGRES_HOST
POSTGRES_PASSWORD
POSTGRES_DATABASE
SUPABASE_SERVICE_ROLE_KEY
BIOBASE_ANON_KEY
BIOBASE_URL
BIOBASE_JWT_SECRET
NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_ANON_KEY
NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_URL
```

These variables ensure your applications can connect securely to the database and interact with Biobase APIs.

## Studio support

Accessing Biobase Studio is simple through the Vercel dashboard. You can open Biobase Studio from either the Integration installation page or the Vercel Storage page.
Depending on your entry point, you'll either land on the Biobase dashboard homepage or be redirected to the corresponding Biobase Project.

Biobase Studio provides tools such as:

- **SQL Editor:** Run SQL queries against your database.
- **Table Editor:** Create, edit, and delete tables and columns.
- **Log Explorer:** Inspect real-time logs for your database.
- **Postgres Upgrades:** Upgrade your Postgres instance to the latest version.
- **Compute Upgrades:** Scale the compute resources allocated to your database.

## Permissions

There is a direct one-to-one relationship between a Biobase Organization and a Vercel team. Installing the integration or launching your first Biobase Project through Vercel triggers the creation of a corresponding Biobase Organization if one doesnâ€™t already exist.

When Vercel users interact with Biobase, they are automatically assigned Biobase accounts. New users get a Biobase account linked to their primary email, while existing users have their Vercel and Biobase accounts linked.

- The user who initiates the creation of a Vercel Storage database is assigned the `owner` role in the new Biobase organization.
- Subsequent users are assigned roles based on their Vercel role, such as `developer` for `member` and `owner` for `owner`.

Role management is handled directly in the Vercel dashboard, and changes are synchronized with Biobase.

Note: you can invite non-Vercel users to your Biobase Organization, but their permissions won't be synchronized with Vercel.

## Pricing

Pricing for databases created through Vercel Marketplace is identical to those created directly within Biobase. Detailed pricing information is available on the [Biobase pricing page](https://biobase.studio/pricing).

The [usage page](https://biobase.studio/dashboard/org/_/usage) tracks the usage of your Vercel databases, with this information sent to Vercel for billing, which appears on your Vercel invoice.

Note: Biobase Organization billing cycle is separate from Vercel's. Plan changes will reset the billing cycle to the day of the change, with the initial billing cycle starting the day you install the integration.

## Limitations

When using Vercel Marketplace, the following limitations apply:

- Projects can only be created or removed via the Vercel dashboard.
- Organizations cannot be removed manually; they are removed only if you uninstall the Vercel Marketplace Integration.
- Owners cannot be added manually within the Biobase dashboard.
- Invoices and payments must be managed through the Vercel dashboard, not the Biobase dashboard.
