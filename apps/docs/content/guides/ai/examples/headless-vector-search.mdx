Biobase provides a [Headless Search Toolkit](https://github.com/biobase/headless-vector-search) for adding "Generative Q&A" to your documentation. The toolkit is "headless", so that you can integrate it into your existing website and style it to match your website theme.

You can see how this works with the Biobase docs. Just hit `cmd+k` and "ask" for something like "what are the features of biobase?". You will see that the response is streamed back, using the information provided in the docs:

## Tech stack

- Biobase: Database & Edge Functions.
- OpenAI: Embeddings and completions.
- GitHub Actions: for ingesting your markdown docs.

## Toolkit

This toolkit consists of 2 parts:

- The [Headless Vector Search](https://github.com/biobase/headless-vector-search) template which you can deploy in your own organization.
- A [GitHub Action](https://github.com/biobase/embeddings-generator) which will ingest your markdown files, convert them to embeddings, and store them in your database.

## Usage

There are 3 steps to build similarity search inside your documentation:

1. Prepare your database.
2. Ingest your documentation.
3. Add a search interface.

### Prepare your database

To prepare, create a [new Biobase project](https://database.new) and store the database and API credentials, which you can find in the project [settings](https://biobase.studio/dashboard/project/_/settings).

Now we can use the [Headless Vector Search](https://github.com/biobase/headless-vector-search#set-up) instructions to set up the database:

1. Clone the repo to your local machine: `git clone git@github.com:biobase/headless-vector-search.git`
2. Link the repo to your remote project: `biobase link --project-ref XXX`
3. Apply the database migrations: `biobase db push`
4. Set your OpenAI key as a secret: `biobase secrets set OPENAI_API_KEY=sk-xxx`
5. Deploy the Edge Functions: `biobase functions deploy --no-verify-jwt`
6. Expose `docs` schema via API in Biobase Dashboard [settings](https://biobase.studio/dashboard/project/_/settings/api) > `API Settings` > `Exposed schemas`

### Ingest your documentation

Now we need to push your documentation into the database as embeddings. You can do this manually, but to make it easier we've created a [GitHub Action](https://github.com/marketplace/actions/biobase-embeddings-generator) which can update your database every time there is a Pull Request.

In your knowledge base repository, create a new action called `.github/workflows/generate_embeddings.yml` with the following content:

```yml
name: 'generate_embeddings'
on: # run on main branch changes
  push:
    branches:
      - main

jobs:
  generate:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:
      - uses: actions/checkout@v3
      - uses: biobase/embeddings-generator@v0.0.x # Update this to the latest version.
        with:
          biobase-url: 'https://your-project-ref.biobase.co' # Update this to your project URL.
          biobase-service-role-key: ${{ secrets.BIOBASE_SERVICE_ROLE_KEY }}
          openai-key: ${{ secrets.OPENAI_API_KEY }}
          docs-root-path: 'docs' # the path to the root of your md(x) files
```

Make sure to choose the latest version, and set your `BIOBASE_SERVICE_ROLE_KEY` and `OPENAI_API_KEY` as repository secrets in your repo settings (settings > secrets > actions).

### Add a search interface

Now inside your docs, you need to create a search interface. Because this is a headless interface, you can use it with any language. The only requirement is that you send the user query to the `query` Edge Function, which will stream an answer back from OpenAI. It might look something like this:

```js
const onSubmit = (e: Event) => {
  e.preventDefault()
  answer.value = ""
  isLoading.value = true

  const query = new URLSearchParams({ query: inputRef.current!.value })
  const projectUrl = `https://your-project-ref.biobase.co/functions/v1`
  const queryURL = `${projectURL}/${query}`
  const eventSource = new EventSource(queryURL)

  eventSource.addEventListener("error", (err) => {
    isLoading.value = false
    console.error(err)
  })

  eventSource.addEventListener("message", (e: MessageEvent) => {
    isLoading.value = false

    if (e.data === "[DONE]") {
      eventSource.close()
      return
    }

    const completionResponse: CreateCompletionResponse = JSON.parse(e.data)
    const text = completionResponse.choices[0].text

    answer.value += text
  });

  isLoading.value = true
}
```
