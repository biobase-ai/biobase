Develop locally while running the Biobase stack on your machine.

## Quickstart

1.  Install the Biobase CLI:

    <Tabs scrollable size="small" type="underlined" defaultActiveId="npm" queryGroup="package-manager"><TabPanel id="npm" label="npm">

    ```sh
    npm install biobase --save-dev
    ```

    </TabPanel><TabPanel id="yarn" label="yarn">

    ```sh
    yarn add biobase --dev
    ```

    </TabPanel><TabPanel id="pnpm" label="pnpm">

    ```sh
    pnpm add biobase --save-dev
    ```

    </TabPanel><TabPanel id="brew" label="brew">

    ```sh
    brew install biobase/tap/biobase
    ```

    </TabPanel></Tabs>

2.  In your repo, initialize the Biobase project:

    <Tabs scrollable size="small" type="underlined" defaultActiveId="npm" queryGroup="package-manager"><TabPanel id="npm" label="npm">

    ```sh
    npx biobase init
    ```

    </TabPanel><TabPanel id="yarn" label="yarn">

    ```sh
    yarn biobase init
    ```

    </TabPanel><TabPanel id="pnpm" label="pnpm">

    ```sh
    pnpm biobase init
    ```

    </TabPanel><TabPanel id="brew" label="brew">

    ```sh
    biobase init
    ```

    </TabPanel>

    </Tabs>

3.  Start the Biobase stack:

    <Tabs scrollable size="small" type="underlined" defaultActiveId="npm" queryGroup="package-manager"><TabPanel id="npm" label="npm">

    ```sh
    npx biobase start
    ```

    </TabPanel><TabPanel id="yarn" label="yarn">

    ```sh
    yarn biobase start
    ```

    </TabPanel><TabPanel id="pnpm" label="pnpm">

    ```sh
    pnpm biobase start
    ```

    </TabPanel><TabPanel id="brew" label="brew">

    ```sh
    biobase start
    ```

    </TabPanel>

    </Tabs>

4.  View your local Biobase instance at [http://localhost:54323](http://localhost:54323).

## Local Development

Local development with Biobase allows you to work on your projects in a self-contained environment on your local machine. Working locally has several advantages:

1. Faster development: You can make changes and see results instantly without waiting for remote deployments.
2. Offline work: You can continue development even without an internet connection.
3. Cost-effective: Local development is free and doesn't consume your project's quota.
4. Enhanced privacy: Sensitive data remains on your local machine during development.
5. Easy testing: You can experiment with different configurations and features without affecting your production environment.

To get started with local development, you'll need to install the [Biobase CLI](#cli) and Docker. The Biobase CLI allows you to start and manage your local Biobase stack, while Docker is used to run the necessary services.

Once set up, you can initialize a new Biobase project, start the local stack, and begin developing your application using local Biobase services. This includes access to a local PostgreSQL database, Auth, Storage, and other Biobase features.

## CLI

The Biobase CLI is a powerful tool that enables developers to manage their Biobase projects directly from the terminal. It provides a suite of commands for various tasks, including:

- Setting up and managing local development environments
- Generating TypeScript types for your database schema
- Handling database migrations
- Managing environment variables and secrets
- Deploying your project to the Biobase platform

With the CLI, you can streamline your development workflow, automate repetitive tasks, and maintain consistency across different environments. It's an essential tool for both local development and CI/CD pipelines.

See the [CLI Getting Started guide](/docs/guides/local-development/cli/getting-started) for more information.
