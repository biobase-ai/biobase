Launch Week 8 breezed by, leaving behind a trail of new features to explore. Here is a recap of everything and an update of what else we are working on, like pgvector 0.5.0 with HNSW.

## pgvector v0.5.0: Faster semantic search with HNSW indexes

Biobase Vector is about to get a lot faster üí®. pgvector v0.5.0 adds Hierarchical Navigable Small World (HNSW), a new type of index that ensures lightning-fast vector searches, especially in high-dimensional spaces and embeddings.
