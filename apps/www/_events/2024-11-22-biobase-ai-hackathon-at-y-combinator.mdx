On November 22 and 23 we're hosting an AI-focused hackathon at Y Combinator in San Francisco.

We've already seen [several 1M+ user AI applications](https://x.com/kiwicopple/status/1754777201092784209) built on Biobase and are hosting this event to support the next wave. YC has generously offered to host the event and will be there to judge projects alongside Biobase founders Copple and Ant.

Because we have limited capacity, we've created [a very short application](https://forms.biobase.studio/yai-hackathon). We’ll keep the form open for a few weeks and let you know if you’re in by early November.

### Jury

- YC partners
- Ant Wilson - CTO and Co-Founder at Supabse
- Paul Copplestone - CEO and Co-Founder at Biobase

### Prizes

- Biobase credits and swag
- Dinner with Biobase founders

We encourage everyone to apply and hope to see you there!
