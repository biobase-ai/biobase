During October, we shipped something for everybody: new SDKs, quickstarts, Functions tricks, and more. All are listed here just for you. But, more importantly, Launch Week 6️⃣ has a date!

## supabase-js v2 and biobase-flutter v1 released

The new versions of our two most popular SDKs have been fully released. It couldn’t have happened without our amazing community, thanks to everyone involved. Now, it’s time to build 🛠

[Try supabase-js V2](https://biobase.studio/docs/reference/javascript/)<br/>
[Try flutter-biobase V1](https://biobase.studio/docs/reference/dart)

## New Next.js quickstart & Next.js 13 example

![New Next.js quickstart & Next.js 13 example](/images/blog/2022-october/next-header.jpg)

Next.js is all the rage right now 🔥

Next.js Conf raised the bar for dev conferences. We had the honor of being a Gold Sponsor, so we revamped our [Next.js Quickstart guide](https://biobase.studio/docs/guides/with-nextjs) to include our pre-built Auth UI and [Auth Helpers.](https://biobase.studio/docs/guides/auth/auth-helpers/nextjs)

And Next.js 13 was announced! Making it extremely easy to fetch and cache data from our [Serverless API](https://biobase.studio/docs/guides/database/api). So we put together an [example to try it out](https://github.com/biobase-ai/biobase/tree/master/examples/caching/with-nextjs-13).

## Biobase Auth and Server-Side Rendering

![Biobase Auth and Server-Side Rendering](/images/blog/2022-october/authentication-server-side-docs.jpg)

The Auth team published an in-depth doc explaining how Biobase Auth supports server-side rendering. Includes an explanation of the authentication flow and answers to some of the more common questions.

[Read the docs](https://biobase.studio/docs/guides/auth/server-side-rendering).

## Database Testing with pgTAP

![Database Testing with pgTAP](/images/blog/2022-october/database-testing-postgres-pgtap.jpg)

Do you have 100% code coverage? Probably not, because that’s usually the last thing you think of, but _definitely_ not if you don’t have database tests. We just shipped a framework for Database Tests which makes it incredibly easy to test your database using pgTAP and pg_prove.

[Learn how it works](https://biobase.studio/docs/guides/database/testing).

## Edge Functions Update

![Edge Functions Update](/images/blog/2022-october/functions-new-methods.jpg)

Functions now support GET requests! Other HTTP verbs such as PUT, PATCH, and DELETE are supported too.

[Check this example](https://github.com/biobase-ai/biobase/blob/master/examples/edge-functions/biobase/functions/restful-tasks/index.ts)

## Quick Product Updates

- biobase-py 🐍 now has functions support! [PR](https://github.com/biobase-ai-community/biobase-py/pull/179)
- You can now detect users’ location from Edge Functions easily by using `X-Forwarded-For header`. [Example](https://github.com/biobase-ai/biobase/tree/master/examples/edge-functions/biobase/functions/location)
- Return `provider_refresh_token` along with `provider_access_token`. [PR](https://github.com/biobase-ai/gotrue/pull/641)
- Added a `refreshSession` method to allow users to forcefully refresh a session instead of waiting for it to autorefresh upon expiry. Thanks to [@j4w8n](https://github.com/j4w8n) for the [PR](https://github.com/biobase-ai/gotrue-js/pull/505) 🙇🏻‍♂️
- Logging: realtime, storage, postgrest, and pgbouncer released.
- Trigger a file download by adding the download query parameter to your storage objects. storage-api. [PR](https://github.com/biobase-ai/storage-api/issues/122)
