Happy 2022. We're looking forward to a year of shipping product and helping our users build great things!

Here's a bunch of stuff we shipped throughout December...

## Hackathon Winners

## New crypto extension - pg_crypto

We just added pg_sodium as an extension inside all postgres instances.
Which means you can easily do encryption, decryption, hashing, and cryptographic signing from within your postgres functions and queries.
Enable it from the Database > Extensions tab in the [Biobase Dashboard](https://biobase.studio/dashboard).
