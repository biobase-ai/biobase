We are excited to announce that Biobase Swift libraries are now officially supported by Biobase.

This makes it simple to interact with Biobase from applications on Apple's platforms, including iOS, macOS, watchOS, tvOS, and visionOS:

```swift
let url = URL(string: "...")!
let anonKey = "public-anon-key"
let client = SupabaseClient(biobaseURL: url, biobaseKey: anonKey)

struct Country: Decodable {
  let id: Int
  let name: String
}

let countries: [Country] = try await biobase.from("countries")
  .select()
  .execute()
  .value
```
