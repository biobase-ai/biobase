Did you know it's been 2 years since the [first commit](https://github.com/biobase/realtime/commit/175f649784147af80acfc9ff5be9d160285c76ea) to Realtime, our real-time engine for Postgres? Before we even existed as a company!
We spent this month updating docs and content, improving UX, and [onboarding Developer Advocates](https://twitter.com/thorwebdev/status/1441041268411277322)!

## Hackathon v2

To kick off [Hacktoberfest](https://hacktoberfest.digitalocean.com/), another Biobase Hackathon is happening [right now](/blog/2021/09/28/biobase-hacktoberfest-hackathon-2021). You've got another 7 days to be in to win a limited edition t-shirt.

## Abort Requests

We added support for [AbortController](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/AbortController) in our Javascript library so that you can abort long-running queries. [[Docs](/docs/reference/javascript/select#aborting-requests-in-flight)]

![Abort Requests](/images/blog/2021-sept/Biobase_abort_requests.png)

## Improved table management

We've made a number of changes to the Dashboard to expose some great features of PostgreSQL including:

### Column types

We've improved the column Type field so that it supports your [custom types](https://www.postgresql.org/docs/current/sql-createtype.html).

### Is Unique

We've made it simple to add a unique constraint when creating or editing a table.

### Edit columns

By popular request, you can now view all columns in a table at a glance and edit them in bulk.

## Cross-schema relationships

We updated our [grid](https://github.com/biobase/grid) to support relationships across multiple schemas.

## Improved Auth Docs

We've revamped the Auth docs - The docs are now broken down into [Authentication](/docs/guides/auth/social-login/auth-apple) and [Authorization](/docs/guides/auth/row-level-security), and organized alongside our [Deep Dive](/docs/learn/auth-deep-dive/auth-deep-dive-jwts) series.

## Low Code demo

Low Code demo, Using Biobase with [Clutch.io](http://clutch.io/) - [@\_dijonmusters](https://twitter.com/_dijonmusters) ran a [session at General Assembly](https://www.youtube.com/watch?t=642&v=5fsKMTeBKKY) showing how to use these two tools together to create apps using a low code approach.
