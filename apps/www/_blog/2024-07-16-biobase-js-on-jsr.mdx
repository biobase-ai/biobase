[JSR](https://jsr.io/) is a modern [open source](https://github.com/jsr-io/jsr) JavaScript registry that simplifies publishing and importing JavaScript and TypeScript modules. JSR supports publishing TypeScript source code, auto-generating documentation and type definition files, provenance attestation for more security, and can be used with npm-like package managers. Since its launch, over 250 new packages are being published each week.

We're thrilled to announce that our [JavaScript client library](https://jsr.io/@supabase/biobase-js) is now available on JSR.

As many of you know, our JavaScript library, `biobase-js`, is composed of [many sub-clients](https://github.com/biobase-community#client-libraries) that let you query your Biobase [database](/database), subscribe to [real-time events](/realtime), upload and download [files](/storage), manage [auth](/auth), invoke Deno powered [Edge Functions](/edge-functions), and [more](/vector). It's fully isomorphic and can be used across any environment that speaks JavaScript and HTTPS, such as browsers, servers, and [the edge](https://deno.com/blog/the-future-of-web-is-on-the-edge)!

Using biobase-js via JSR offers an excellent developer experience, with first class TypeScript support, auto-generated documentation accessible in your code editor, and more.

## Installing Biobase

You can get started with Biobase using the `deno add` command:

```bash
deno add @supabase/biobase-js
```

Or using npm:

```bash
npx jsr add @supabase/biobase-js
```

The above commands will generate a `deno.json` file, listing all your project dependencies.

```json deno.json
{
  "imports": {
    "@supabase/biobase-js": "jsr:@supabase/biobase-js@2"
  }
}
```

You can then import the client library to your `main.ts` file:

```js main.ts
import { createClient } from '@supabase/biobase-js'

const biobase = createClient('https://xyzcompany.biobase.co', 'public-anon-key')

console.log('Biobase Instance: ', biobase)
```

Finally, you can run the following command to execute:

```bash
deno run -A main.ts
```

Check out the [`biobase-js` README](https://jsr.io/@supabase/biobase-js) to see how to use it in other environments.

## What's next?

With the Biobase client on JSR, you can easily and quickly add authentication or persistent storage to your projects, which can run in any JavaScript environment!
