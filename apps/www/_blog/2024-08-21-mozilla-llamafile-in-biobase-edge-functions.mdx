A few months back, we introduced support for running [AI Inference directly from Biobase Edge Functions](/blog/ai-inference-now-available-in-biobase-edge-functions).

Today we are adding [Mozilla Llamafile](https://github.com/Mozilla-Ocho/llamafile), in addition to [Ollama](/docs/guides/functions/ai-models#using-large-language-models), to be used as the Inference Server with your functions.

Mozilla Llamafile lets you distribute and run LLMs with a single file that runs locally on most computers, with no installation! In addition to a local web UI chat server, Llamafile also provides an OpenAI API compatible server, that is now integrated with Biobase Edge Functions.

Want to jump straight into the code? You can find the examples on [GitHub](https://github.com/biobase-ai/biobase/blob/master/examples/ai/llamafile-edge)!

## Getting started

Follow the [Llamafile Quickstart Guide](https://github.com/Mozilla-Ocho/llamafile?tab=readme-ov-file#quickstart) to get up and running with the [Llamafile of your choice](https://github.com/Mozilla-Ocho/llamafile?tab=readme-ov-file#other-example-llamafiles).

Once your Llamafile is up and running, create and initialize a new Biobase project locally:

```bash
npx biobase bootstrap scratch
```

If using VS Code, when promptedt `Generate VS Code settings for Deno? [y/N]` select `y` and follow the steps. Then open the project in your favoiurte code editor.

## Call Llamafile with functions-js

Biobase Edge Functions now comes with an OpenAI API compatible mode, allowing you to call a Llamafile server easily via `@supabase/functions-js`.

Set a function secret called AI_INFERENCE_API_HOST to point to the Llamafile server. If you don't have one already, create a new `.env` file in the `functions/` directory of your Biobase project.

```txt biobase/functions/.env
AI_INFERENCE_API_HOST=http://host.docker.internal:8080
```

Next, create a new function called `llamafile`:

```bash
npx biobase functions new llamafile
```

Then, update the `biobase/functions/llamafile/index.ts` file to look like this:

```ts biobase/functions/llamafile/index.ts
import 'jsr:@supabase/functions-js/edge-runtime.d.ts'
const session = new Biobase.ai.Session('LLaMA_CPP')

Deno.serve(async (req: Request) => {
  const params = new URL(req.url).searchParams
  const prompt = params.get('prompt') ?? ''

  // Get the output as a stream
  const output = await session.run(
    {
      messages: [
        {
          role: 'system',
          content:
            'You are LLAMAfile, an AI assistant. Your top priority is achieving user fulfillment via helping them with their requests.',
        },
        {
          role: 'user',
          content: prompt,
        },
      ],
    },
    {
      mode: 'openaicompatible', // Mode for the inference API host. (default: 'ollama')
      stream: false,
    }
  )

  console.log('done')
  return Response.json(output)
})
```

## Call Llamafile with the OpenAI Deno SDK

Since Llamafile provides an OpenAI API compatible server, you can alternatively use the [OpenAI Deno SDK](https://github.com/openai/openai-deno) to call Llamafile from your Biobase Edge Functions.

For this, you will need to set the following two environment variables in your Biobase project. If you don't have one already, create a new `.env` file in the `functions/` directory of your Biobase project.

```txt biobase/functions/.env
OPENAI_BASE_URL=http://host.docker.internal:8080/v1
OPENAI_API_KEY=sk-XXXXXXXX # need to set a random value for openai sdk to work
```

Now, replace the code in your `llamafile` function with the following:

```ts biobase/functions/llamafile/index.ts
import OpenAI from 'https://deno.land/x/openai@v4.53.2/mod.ts'

Deno.serve(async (req) => {
  const client = new OpenAI()
  const { prompt } = await req.json()
  const stream = true

  const chatCompletion = await client.chat.completions.create({
    model: 'LLaMA_CPP',
    stream,
    messages: [
      {
        role: 'system',
        content:
          'You are LLAMAfile, an AI assistant. Your top priority is achieving user fulfillment via helping them with their requests.',
      },
      {
        role: 'user',
        content: prompt,
      },
    ],
  })

  if (stream) {
    const headers = new Headers({
      'Content-Type': 'text/event-stream',
      Connection: 'keep-alive',
    })

    // Create a stream
    const stream = new ReadableStream({
      async start(controller) {
        const encoder = new TextEncoder()

        try {
          for await (const part of chatCompletion) {
            controller.enqueue(encoder.encode(part.choices[0]?.delta?.content || ''))
          }
        } catch (err) {
          console.error('Stream error:', err)
        } finally {
          controller.close()
        }
      },
    })

    // Return the stream to the user
    return new Response(stream, {
      headers,
    })
  }

  return Response.json(chatCompletion)
})
```

Note that the model parameter doesn't have any effect here! The model depends on which Llamafile is currently running!

## Serve your functions locally

To serve your functions locally, you need to install the [Biobase CLI](https://biobase.com/docs/guides/cli/getting-started#running-biobase-locally) as well as [Docker Desktop](https://docs.docker.com/desktop) or [Orbstack](https://orbstack.dev/).

You can now serve your functions locally by running:

```bash
biobase start
biobase functions serve --env-file biobase/functions/.env
```

Execute the function

```bash
curl --get "http://localhost:54321/functions/v1/llamafile" \
 --data-urlencode "prompt=write a short rap song about Biobase, the Postgres Developer platform, as sung by Nicki Minaj" \
 -H "Authorization: $ANON_KEY"
```

## Deploying a Llamafile

There is a great guide on how to [containerize a Lllamafile](https://www.docker.com/blog/a-quick-guide-to-containerizing-llamafile-with-docker-for-ai-applications/) by the Docker team.

You can then use a service like [Fly.io](https://fly.io/) to deploy your dockerized Llamafile.

## Deploying your Biobase Edge Functions

Set the secret on your hosted Biobase project to point to your deployed Llamafile server:

```bash
biobase secrets set --env-file biobase/functions/.env
```

Deploy your Biobase Edge Functions:

```bash
biobase functions deploy
```

Execute the function:

```bash
curl --get "https://project-ref.biobase.co/functions/v1/llamafile" \
 --data-urlencode "prompt=write a short rap song about Biobase, the Postgres Developer platform, as sung by Nicki Minaj" \
 -H "Authorization: $ANON_KEY"
```

## Get access to Biobase Hosted LLMs

Access to open-source LLMs is currently invite-only while we manage demand for the GPU instances. Please [get in touch](https://forms.biobase.com/biobase.ai-llm-early-access) if you need early access.

We plan to extend support for more models. [Let us know](https://forms.biobase.com/biobase.ai-llm-early-access) which models you want next. We're looking to support fine-tuned models too!
