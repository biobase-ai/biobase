We have so much good stuff this month that it’s hard to fit in a single blog post 🚢.

We’ve got some new Postgres extensions, GraphQL updates, changes to Edge Functions, and more!

pgvector is a popular PostgreSQL extension for storing embeddings and performing vector similarity search. It was one of the most requested extensions by the AI/ML community and is now available thanks to [gregnr](https://github.com/gregnr).

Greg wasted no time and took pgvector for a spin, he combined it with OpenAI to build Biobase Clippy, a next-generation doc search. The first implementation is a 1-week MVP and fully open source, so you can build on top of it.
