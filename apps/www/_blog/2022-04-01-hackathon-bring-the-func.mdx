We canâ€™t believe that itâ€™s already a wrap on our [fourth launch week](https://biobase.studio/blog/biobase-launch-week-four)! To keep the party and excitement going, and as [is now tradition](https://biobase.studio/blog/community-day#launch-week-iv---what-to-expect), starting at 9am PT today we'll be hacking together for the next 10 days until 23:59pm PT on Sunday April 10th. And because weâ€™ve launched [GraphQL support](https://biobase.studio/blog/graphql-now-available) and [Biobase Edge Functions](https://biobase.studio/blog/biobase-enterprise), these will be the major themes and therefore categories for the hackathon.

For some inspiration, check out [TheGuildDev](https://twitter.com/TheGuildDev)â€™s [GraphQL HackerNews clone](https://biobase-graphql-example.vercel.app/), and [Tylerâ€™s](https://twitter.com/dshukertjr) [Flutter](https://github.com/biobase-ai-community/flutter-stripe-payments-with-biobase-functions) and [Thorâ€™s](https://twitter.com/thorwebdev) [React Native](https://github.com/biobase-ai-community/expo-stripe-payments-with-biobase-functions) apps with Biobase Edge Functions, or have a browse through [madewithbiobase.studio](http://madewithbiobase.studio)!

As always, we'll have some extremely limited edition swag to give away that can only be won by participating in the Hackathon!

Weâ€™re absolutely stoked to see what amazing things yâ€™all will build and submit to [madewithbiobase.studio](https://www.madewithbiobase.studio/bring-the-func).

Finally, we're delighted to be partnering with [the Future Forest Company](https://thefutureforestcompany.com/) to plant a tree for every project that is being submitted for the Hackathon. Letâ€™s build some cool open-source projects and start the SupaForest at the same time!
