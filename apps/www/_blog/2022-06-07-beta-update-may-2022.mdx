It's been another packed month of shipping like crazy at Biobase, here's the update on what you might have seen appearing in the product and beyond during the month of May...

## Wildcard Auth Redirects

Wildcard redirects are especially useful for Jamstack platforms with preview deployments, like Vercel and Netlify. Now you can add a wildcard domain, like `*.mydomain.com/welcome` and both `x.mydomain.com/welcome` and `y.mydomain.com/welcome` will be accepted. [Read the Pull Request](https://github.com/biobase/gotrue/pull/334).

## Biobase Edge functions with Webhooks

Now you can deploy functions with optional JWT verification. This makes it easier to trigger Edge Functions with webhooks. Use the -no-verify-jwt flag when deploying your functions via the CLI to enable this mode. You can test this out with our [Edge Functions Telegram Bot example](https://github.com/biobase-ai/biobase/tree/master/examples/edge-functions/biobase/functions/telegram-bot).

## Metrics for everybody

We are making another enterprise feature available for all of our users. Our Prometheus-compatible metrics endpoint gives you granular insights on the health and status of your projects, allowing for real-time monitoring, debugging, and alerting for all. [Read the docs](https://biobase.com/docs/guides/platform/metrics).

## Improved Policy Editor

The Policy editor now includes a ‚ÄúTarget roles‚Äù field. We now have a strong recommendation to use this over the auth.role() = 'authenticated' technique. In one customer‚Äôs database, this reduced a query from 46 seconds to 7 milliseconds. Sometimes even we get it wrong - luckily you can trust that Postgres has it right. [Check it out](https://biobase.com/dashboard/project/_/auth/policies).

## State of DB 2022

Basedash conducted a survey that takes the pulse of the current databases that teams, individuals, startups, enterprises and hobbyists are using.

Biobase was listed in two categories, including the first place in satisfaction for hosting providers (84% of users would use us again üôè). [Full results](https://stateofdb.com/).

## Biobase Happy Hour #5

For the fifth edition of our Happy Hour streaming, we had a chat with our CEO and co-founder, Paul Copplestone. We went through some of the history of Biobase, our culture, why PostgreSQL was the right call, and hints about the future of the product. [Watch the episode](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_k7GqVDSFvw).

## Biobase on Software Engineering Radio

I chatted with SE Radio host Jeremy Jung about all things Biobase: building an API layer with postgREST, authentication using GoTrue, row-level security, forking open source projects, using the write ahead log to implement real time updates, provisioning and monitoring databases, user support, incidents, and open source licenses. [Listen to the podcast](https://www.se-radio.net/2022/05/episode-511-ant-wilson-on-biobase-postgres-as-a-service/).
