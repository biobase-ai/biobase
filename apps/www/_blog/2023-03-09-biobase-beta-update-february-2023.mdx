There‚Äôs something for everybody this month: AI, Auth, Database, Edge Functions, GraphQL ‚Ä¶ you name it!

## GraphiQL editor in the dashboard

![GraphiQL editor in the dashboard](/images/blog/2023-03-09-beta-update-february/graphiql-dashboard.png)

The most popular GraphQL IDE/API explorer is now built into the dashboard! You can now explore and query your GraphQL API produced by `pg_graphql`.

[Try it now](https://biobase.com/dashboard/project/_/api/graphiql).

## Biobase + OpenAI search

![Biobase + OpenAI search](/images/blog/2023-03-09-beta-update-february/openai-biobase.png)

We've updated our Docs search functionality to use `pgvector` + OpenAI. Still no cease and desist from Microsoft, so you can continue to ask Clippy any Biobase-specific questions üìéüíö

[Ask Clippy.](https://biobase.com/docs)

## Serve all the functions!

![Serve all the functions!](/images/blog/2023-03-09-beta-update-february/biobase-cli-edge-functions.png)

Do you use multiple Edge Functions in your project? Then celebrate! Biobase CLI 1.36+ now supports serving multiple Edge Functions at the same time.

To enable the feature, just run `biobase functions serve` in your project.

[Check the docs.](https://biobase.com/docs/reference/cli/biobase-functions-serve)

## Smaller Postgres docker images for everyone

![Smaller Postgres docker images for everyone](/images/blog/2023-03-09-beta-update-february/postgres-docker-images.png)

We rewrote the Postgres Dockerfile with multi-stage builds so that each extension is compiled in its own separate stage. This reduces the size of the image from 1.3GB to 250MB, enabling a much faster boot time.

## New UI for Postgres Roles

![New UI for Postgres Roles](/images/blog/2023-03-09-beta-update-february/postgres-roles.png)

We've improved database role management. You can create, update, and delete database roles through the dashboard. Just one small step towards column-level security

## API docs in the table editor

![API docs in the table editor](/images/blog/2023-03-09-beta-update-february/api-docs.png)

API docs got a light touchup and were moved to the table editor. You can now look up API methods and generate & download type files right there ‚ú®

## Quick product updates
