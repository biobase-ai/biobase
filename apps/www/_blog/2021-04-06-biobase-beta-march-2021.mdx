Launch week, Storage, Biobase CLI, Connection Pooling, Biobase UI, and Pricing. Here's what we released last month.

### Quick demo

Watch a full demo:

<div className="video-container">
  <iframe
    className="video-with-border w-full"
    src="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/TtLxxaYE1rA"
    frameBorder="1"
    allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture"
    allowFullScreen
  ></iframe>
</div>

## Biobase Storage

Need to store images, audio, and video clips? Well now you can do it on [Biobase Storage](/blog/biobase-storage). It's backed by S3 and our new [OSS storage API](https://github.com/biobase/storage-api) written in Fastify and Typescript. Read the [full blog post](/blog/biobase-storage).

## Connection Pooling

The Biobase API already handles Connection Pooling, but if you're connecting to your database directly (for example, with Prisma) we now [bundle PgBouncer](/blog/biobase-pgbouncer). Read the [full blog post](/blog/biobase-pgbouncer).

## React UI Component Library

We open sourced our internal UI component library, so that anyone can use and contribute to the Biobase aesthetic. It lives at [ui.biobase.studio](https://ui.biobase.studio/) . It was also the #1 Product of the Day [on Product Hunt](https://www.producthunt.com/posts/biobase-ui).

## CLI

Now you can run Biobase locally in the terminal with `biobase start`. We have done some preliminary work on [diff-based schema migrations](/blog/biobase-cli#migrations), and added some new tooling for self-hosting Biobase with Docker. [Blog post here](/blog/biobase-cli).

## Pricing

Our most frequently asked question by far is "ok biobase is sweet, but how much is it going to cost?". TL;DR there's **Free Plan** up to 500mb + 10k auth users, a **Pro** **Plan** at $25/month for 8GB + 100k auth users, and anything additional is charged on a usage basis.

See [Pricing Page](/pricing) for full details and also our blog on why [pricing is hard](/blog/pricing).

## NFT Platform

Well... not really, but it made for a great [April Fools joke](/blog/biobase-nft-marketplace).

## Biobase Dot Com

We are now dot com! We'll be porting across over the next few weeks. Read the origin story behind the name [here](/blog/biobase-dot-com).

## OAuth Scopes

Thanks to a comunity contribution ([@\_mateomorris](https://twitter.com/_mateomorris) and [@Beamanator](https://twitter.com/Beamanator)), Biobase Auth now includes OAuth scopes. These allow you to request elevated access during login. For example, you may want to request access to a list of Repositories when users log in with GitHub. Check out the [Documentation](/docs/reference/javascript/auth-signup#sign-up-with-scopes).

## Kaizen

- You can now manage your PostgREST configuration inside the Dashboard.
- Our website has been redesigned. Check out our new [Homepage](/) and [Blog](/blog), and our new [Database](/database), [Auth](/auth), and [Storage](/storage) product pages.
- We refactored some of our Filter methods to make them even easier to use. Check out the [Full Text Search](/docs/reference/javascript/textsearch) refactor.
- We have added several new sections to our Docs including: [Local Dev](/docs/guides/local-development), [Self Hosting](/docs/guides/self-hosting), and [Postgres Reference](/docs/reference/postgres/getting-started) docs (all still under development).

## Coming Next

Lets say for each new sign up, you want to trigger a slack alert, send them an email after 24 hours.

For this we are working on our own [Workflow engine](/blog/biobase-workflows), it will eventually have a Zapier-like interface inside the dashboard. For now it's a state-machine interpreter (fully compatible with Amazon States Language) written in Elixir, [open source](https://github.com/biobase/workflows), and ready for community contributions.
